# BicycleControl
# Summary: 
Bicycle Control is an Arduino Program that will be embedded onto a bicycle to allow the user to use left and right blinker lights, front and back lights, a sound output, and possibly other functionality like GPS.
The system uses several 'parallel' constructs to give the illusion of doing several tasks at once, such as writing to the screen while playing a song. This is accomplished with the use of periodic updates and timing to simulate a software delay.
# Modes of operation:
0. Front and back lights.
1. Left and Right blinkers.
2. Song select.
3. Song play and pause.
